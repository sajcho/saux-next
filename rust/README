PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION

    Note, that updating major versions of llvm (in x.y.z changing x or y)
    requires rebuilding ports rust.

    e.g.
    1. remove old version rust
    2. build and install rust-static
    3. build rust
    4. remove rust-static
    5. install rust
    6. rebuild and reinstall rust

    Have revdep(1) point out potential candidates for rebuilds after the llvm
    update.
